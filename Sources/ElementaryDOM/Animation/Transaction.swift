/// A context for applying animations and other changes to the view hierarchy.
///
/// `Transaction` defines how state changes are applied to views, including
/// whether animations should be used and which animation to apply.
///
/// ## Using Transactions
///
/// Typically, you don't create transactions directly. Instead, use ``withAnimation(_:_:)-4pgxw``
/// or ``withTransaction(_:_:)`` to wrap state changes:
///
/// ```swift
/// withAnimation(.smooth) {
///     isExpanded = true
///     offset = 100
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Animation Completion
///
/// Track when animations complete using completion callbacks:
///
/// ```swift
/// withAnimation(.smooth, completionCriteria: .logicallyComplete, {
///     position = targetPosition
/// }, completion: {
///     print("Animation completed")
/// })
/// ```

/// - Parameters:
///   - animation: The animation to apply. Default is ``Animation/default``.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Elementary!

## Contributing Code

By submitting a pull request, you agree to license your contribution under the same open-source license ([Apache 2.0](/LICENSE)) as the rest of the project. You confirm that you have permission to share the work and that it doesn’t infringe on any third-party rights.

As the Elementary ecosystem evolves, maintainers may restructure or relocate code — including contributions — to other open-source repositories within the project to keep things organized and maintainable.

Thanks for contributing and helping the project grow!
